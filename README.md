# Steganography Techniques

Welcome to the Steganography course, exploring techniques and tools for covert communication in cybersecurity.

## What is Steganography?

Steganography is the practice of concealing data within other non-secret data. Unlike cryptography, which focuses on making encrypted data unreadable to unauthorized users, steganography aims to hide the existence of the data.

## Role in Cybersecurity

Steganography plays a crucial role in cybersecurity by providing a method for covert communication and data exfiltration. It can be used to:

- Evade detection and bypass security controls
- Conceal sensitive information within images, audio files, or other digital media
- Embed malicious payloads for stealthy attacks
